## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- My name is Ava (She/Her)
- I'm currently studying Computational Mathematics at RIT
- Mostly I use this account for school stuff that way I can keep my school work seperate from my personal projects but I may add some personal projects to here if they intersect with something I'm working on for class.
- Currently I am working on customizing my phones keyboard because I found that many foss boards don't have nearly as much functionality as many nonFOSS boards.
  - I want to add a morse code board to my phones keyboard so that I can practice my morse code    
- feel free to reach out to me on discord (cainisdelta) or via email (ah1034@rit.edu) or even through matrix (@cainisdelta:matrix.org)
